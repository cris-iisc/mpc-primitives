* Asymmetric encryption refers to a cryptographic system requiring two separate keys, one to encrypt the plaintext, and one to decrypt the ciphertext.
* Neither key will do both functions.
* One of these keys is public and the other is kept private.
* If the encryption key is the one published then the system enables private communication from the public to the decryption key's owner.
