* This is the main interface for the Symmetric Encryption family.

* in which an encryption scheme is composed of three algorithms:<p>
* 	1.	Generation of the key.
*	2.	Encryption of the plaintext.
*	3.	Decryption of the ciphertext.
*
* Any symmetric encryption scheme belongs by default at least to the Eavsdropper Security Level and to the Indistinguishable Security Level.
