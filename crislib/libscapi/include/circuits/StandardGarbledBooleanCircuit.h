/**
*The StandardGarbledBooleanCircuit is a standard garbled circuit that does not use optimizations such as FreeXor and row reduction, only fixed key.
* The 0-wire key and the 1-wire key are not related in any way and are random.
*
* Note that there is some similar code that looks duplicated, but due to performance reasons the duplication is not refactored into
* functions. Calling functions for numerous times decreses the performance.
