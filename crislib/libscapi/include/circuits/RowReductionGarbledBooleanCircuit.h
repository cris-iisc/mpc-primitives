/**
 *The RowReductionGarbledBooleanCircuit uses the Free XOR technique that is explained in depth in "Free XOR Gates and
 * Applications" by Validimir Kolesnikov and Thomas Schneider combined with the techniqe of "Efficient Garbling from a Fixed-Key Blockcipher"
 * It uses the optimization of XOR and NON_XOR gates that can be computed without an encryption due to the way the
 * wire's keys were chosen. See the above papers also for a proof of security of this method.
 * This class also uses the row reduction technique. This means that the 1'st row of each garbled table for a gate is calculated rather than an 
 * encryption whose plaintext is the related key of the output wire. This reduces the size of the entire garbled table by 25%, a crucial element
 * when sending the garbled tables between different machines, especially for far away machines or a slow network.
 * 
 * Note that there is some similar code that looks duplicated, but due to performance reasons the duplication is not refactored into
 * functions. Calling functions for numerous times decreses the performance.
