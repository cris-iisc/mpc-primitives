INTRODUCTION
------------

This package contains an implementation of the Replicated Secret Sharing for three parties and arithmetic circuit protocol.

A general explanation of the protocol can be found at



INSTALLATION AND EXECUTION
--------------------------

In order to compile and run The GMW application:
1. Go in the ReplicatedSecretSharing3PartiesArithmetic directory.
2. Run the make command.
3. to execute run :
 ./ReplicatedSecretSharing3PartiesArithmetic -partyID [party_id] -inputFile [input_file_name] -outputFile [output_file_name] -circuitFileName [circuit_file_name]
                                             -fieldType [field_type] -internalIterationsNumber [internal_iterations_number] -partiesFileName [parties_file_name]


 for example:
 ./ReplicatedSecretSharing3PartiesArithmetic -partyID 0 -inputFile inputs200000.txt -outputFile output.txt -circuitFile ArythmeticStatistics1PairsAnd100000SamplesFor3Parties.txt
                                             -fieldType ZpMersenne61 -internalIterationsNumber 10 -partiesFile Parties.txt
 This executes party number 0 of protocol.
 Notice that the field type can be either ZpMersenne or ZpMersenne61.
